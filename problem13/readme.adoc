= S-99/P13 (**) - Run-length encoding of a list (direct solution).

image::https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange?style=for-the-badge[Difficulty: Medium]

Implement the so-called run-length encoding data compression method directly. I.e. don't use other methods you've written (like link:../problem09/[P09]'s pack); do all the work directly. 

.Example:

```scala
scala> encodeDirect(List('a, 'a, 'a, 'a, 'b, 'c, 'c, 'a, 'a, 'd, 'e, 'e, 'e, 'e))
res0: List[(Int, Symbol)] = List((4,'a), (1,'b), (2,'c), (2,'a), (1,'d), (4,'e))
```
